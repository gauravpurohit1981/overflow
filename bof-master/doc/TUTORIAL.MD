# Introduction

The Buffer-Overflow is perhaps one of the most famous system attacks. The aim of this tutorial is to give some background on what makes this attack possible and to explain it on examples provided in the repository. 

The binaries in this repo are pre-compiled for a 32 bits Linux system and have been tested with 32 bits and 64 bits Virtual Box images of [Kali](https://www.kali.org). 

**WARNING:** The tutorial attacks are only possible when you weaken the default security settings of your system. Please do not try these attacks on the system you normally use and use instead an experimental system (e.g., Virtual Box image). 

To clone the repository within a Linux environment, use the following command (preferably as a non-root user): 

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/morisset/bof.git
```

This will create a folder `bof`, which we will use below. If you already all about virtual memory and gdb, please feel free to skip the Background section and to go straight to [Buffer Overflow](#BufferOverflow). 

**NOTE**: In case you enjoy learning through videos, I recommend the excellent [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo) by Mike Pound. There is a substantial overlap between the content covered in Mike's video and this tutorial. The focus here is more on the understanding and exploiting the binary files provided in the repository. If you access this tutorial though my lectures at Newcastle University, there should also be additional videos in the corresponding Canvas course. 

# Background 

## Virtual Memory

We do not provide in this page a full explanation of how system memory works. However, some important concepts to keep in mind are: 

- Programs are loaded from the hard-drive to the memory to be executed. 
- The memory is organised as a Virtual Memory, with addresses expressed in hexadecimal. 
- The virtual memory contains a range of data: instructions coming from the program, control-flow instructions, user data, etc. Although these different types of data are normally separated, the buffer overflow attack aims at breaking the boundaries. 

If you're familiar with these concepts, you can skip directly to the next section. Otherwise, things will hopefully be clearer once we start playing with the actual code. Don't try to understand everything below, just try to focus on the security relevant bits. In many cases, attackers are capable of compromising a system without understanding it fully: they just need to understand how to break it! 

Let us start with the programme `step1`  (the source file is available in `src`). This is a very simple (and boring) piece of code:

- The function `main` takes one argument from the command line (remember that in C, the first argument is always the name of the program itself, so the actual argument is the second argument), call the function `func` with that argument. 
- The function `func` takes one argument, creates a buffer of 32 bytes, copies the argument in the buffer, and print the content of the buffer. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void func(char *s){
  char buf[32];
  strcpy(buf, s);
  
  printf("you entered: %s\n", buf);  
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
        if(argc != 2){
                printf("Usage: %s some_string\n", argv[0]);
                return 2;
        }
        func(argv[1]);
        return 0;
}
```



If you run this program (you should be able to run the program directly, don't try to recompile it), you'll get: 

```bash
$ ./step1 "hello world"
you entered: hello world
```

So far, so good. Let's now look at the actual program. Use the command `objdump -d step1` (the `-d` option indicates that the code should be disassembled). You should see a bunch of code, including the two sections below, which correspond to the assembly code of the function `func` and `main` respectively: 

```assembly

 8048495:       83 c4 04                add    $0x4,%esp
 8048498:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax
 804849d:       c9                      leave  
 804849e:       c3                      ret    
 804849f:       90                      nop

```

No need to understand everything. Basically, in the left column we have the address in the virtual memory, while in the right column, we have the assembly instructions. Let us focus on the following instruction in `main`: 

```assembly
8048490:       e8 a6 ff ff ff          call   804843b <func>
```

Intuitively, a program executes by having an execution pointer that reads every instruction, one after the other, starting from the initial one. In the case above, the execution pointer reaches the address `8048490`, it will execute the instruction `call 804843b` (it's actually slightly more complicated than that, but this is a good level of abstraction), which moves the pointer to the address `804843b`, which happens to be the first address of the program corresponding to `func`. The pointer will therefore execute: 

```assembly
804843b:       55                      push   %ebp
```

followed by 

```assembly
804843c:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
```

and so on and so forth. However, when the pointer reaches the last address in the `func` block  (`8048463`), how does it know where to return? If it just tries to execute the next address in virtual memory (`804864`), it would start the function `main` from the beginning, which is not what we want. Instead, we want to go back to the address `8048495`, which is the next address after executing the call to `func`. As an analogy, if you are following a recipe for a lasagna and the recipe book tells you to go to another page for the white sauce recipe, you need to remember at which page is the lasagna recipe and at which stage you were once you're done with the white sauce. You could do that for instance by using a post-it or simply rely on your memory. 

The computer effectively relies on its memory, by using the **stack**. The figure below presents a very high level view of the virtual memory. Note that by convention, the lowest address is at the bottom. The program instructions are stored in the part of the memory starting at `0x08048000`, which is why the addresses of functions `main` and `func` above are close to `0x08048000`.  

![Virtual Memory](Virtual Memory.png)

The stack itself is located in a different part of the memory, and is organised in stack frames. A stack frame is allocated for each function call and contains the function arguments, the local variables and the information needed to restore the callerâ€™s state. The **frame pointer** and the **stack pointer** delimit a stack frame. Most information is accessed relative to the frame pointer, as described in the picture below. We can see that just after F.P. (the frame pointer), we have the **return address**, i.e., the address to which we want to return after this function is finished. 

![Stack Frame](Stack Frame.png)

When we call `func`, the system creates a new stack frame, stores the previous frame pointer at the address pointed by the Frame Pointer. 

## Using GDB

Let us examine the stack for the program `step1`. To do this, we use `gdb`, which allows us to debug a program. In the `bof` folder, type: 

```
$gdb step1
```

In gdb, we are going to use four commands: 

* `disas` disassembles a function and shows the code, similar to `objdump -d` 

* `breakpoint` introduces a breakpoint in the execution of the program at a specific address

* `r` run the program (possibly with arguments)

* `x/4x $ebp` display the 4 memory words  starting at the Frame Pointer (which is contained in the register `$ebp`). 

For instance, you can look at the code of the function `func` by typing `disas func` once you are in `gdb`. Let us ignore most the code for now and let us just look at the last two instructions: `leave` is the instruction indicating that we are going to leave the current stack frame and `ret` is the instruction indicating the execution should return to previous frame. How do we know where to return? We can see in the table above the return address is stored in the current stack frame, just above the Frame Pointer. 

![Demo Stack](Demo Stack.png)

In the image above, we set a breakpoint just before the instruction `leave` (which is done with the command `break *0x08048462`) and we run the programme with the argument "Hello World" (which is done with the command `r "Hello World"`). When the execution stops, the memory is still in the stack frame for `func`. We can inspect the 4 words starting from the Frame Pointer (which is done with the command  `x/4x $ebp`) and see: `0xffffd238` (which is the value of the previous frame pointer), followed by `0x08048495` (which is the return address), followed by `0xffffd499` and `0x00000000` (let us ignore these two). If you don't see that, make sure you have correctly set up the breakpoint and run the program. 

What does the return address `0x08048495` correspond to? If you disassemble the function `main`, you can see it corresponds the address immediately after the call to the function `func`: 

![Demo Stack 2](Demo Stack 2.png)

We can finish the execution of the program with the command `cont`, and the process exits normally, which means all went well. Let us try to break things up now! 

# Buffer Overflow

In the previous example, the execution knows where to return to because the return address is stored in memory. However, we can see that it is stored very close to other bits of data, including local variables, which can therefore be modified by the user. This is one of the main vulnerabilities enabling the Buffer Overflow attack: the mix of control flow data (critical) and user input data (not necessarily trusted).

If you look again at the code of the program `step1`, you can see that the function has a local buffer `buf` of size 32 characters.  

```C
void func(char *s){
  char buf[32];
  strcpy(buf, s);
  
  printf("you entered: %s\n", buf);  
}
```

This means that in the stack frame of `func`,  in the part corresponding to local variables, 32 characters of memory will be allocated for `buf`, and the content of the string passed as an argument of `func` will be copied in this space. It might not be adjacent to the Frame Pointer, but it won't be far. You can inspect the memory "below" the Frame Pointer in `gdb` by using `x/-16x` (assuming you still have the breakpoint and run the programme from the start). Try to see if you can locate the string "Hello World" in memory! (You might need to look at ASCII encoding first ...)

What happens if you try to put more than 32 characters in `buf`?  If you are using a modern programming language, such as Java, the memory for a string will be allocated at run-time, which means that Java will automatically allocate the memory needed for the string. However, the example above use static allocation, which means we assume that the string will not be more than 32 characters. 

Let us try to put a very large number of characters, say, 100 "A" in `buf`. Because we don't really want to have to type manually 100 "A", we can use a simple perl script: `perl -e 'print "A" x 100'` prints 100 "A". Be very careful of the quotes, the syntax is very specific! 

We can now run the debugger from the start (note that in order to use the perl script as an argument for `r`, we need to use back-ticks. Yes, we use three types of quotes in  ``r `perl -e 'print "A" x 100'` ``. )

![Demo Stack 3](Demo Stack 3.png)

We can see that when we inspect the memory at `$ebp`, all memory seems to be filled with the value `41`, which is the ASCII code for "A"! In other words, the program started copying the symbol "A" from the local variable part of the stack frame and kept copying above, erasing the Frame Pointer, the return address and even the arguments of the function. As a result, when the execution leaves the function `func`, it tries to go to the address `0x41414141`, which is not allowed (there is no program to be executed at this address) and leads to a segmentation fault (which means that the execution tries to go into the wrong segment of the memory). 

Congratulations, you just did your first Buffer Overflow attack! 

## Control Flow Redirection

The attack above leads to crashing `step1` by causing a segmentation fault. Crashing a program can be used if an attacker tries to limit the availability of a system, but it is usually quite limited. However, what if, instead of redirecting the execution to the arbitrary address  `0x41414141`, we could instead redirect it to a memory address we could exploit? 

Let us look at the next file in the repository: `step2.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int func(char *s){
  char buf[32];
  strcpy(buf, s);
  
  printf("you entered: %s\n", buf);
  if(strcmp(buf, "secret")) { 
    return 0;
  }
  return 1;  
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
        if(argc != 2){
                printf("Usage: %s some_string\n", argv[0]);
                return 2;
        }
        int res = func(argv[1]);

        if (! res) {
          printf("you are denied\n");
          return 0;
        }

        printf("you are allowed\n");
        return 0;
}
```

The overall structure is very close to that of `step1.c`, with a function `main` calling a function `func`. The main difference is that `func` is now doing something more "useful": it compares the input to the string `secret`, and returns 0 if it's the same, 1 otherwise. If `func` returns 0, `main` prints "you are allowed", and  prints "you are denied" otherwise. In practice, you could imagine `main` doing something more critical, like copying files. If you try to execute this program, you'll get this: 

```bash
~/bof$ ./step2 notsecret
you entered: notsecret
you are denied

~/bof$ ./step2 secret
you entered: secret
you are allowed
```

Can we exploit the Buffer Overflow so that we input a string different from "secret", and yet get the programme to print "you are allowed"? Yes! 

To realise this attack, you need to look a bit into the assembly code of `main` in `step2`: 

![Demo step2](Demo step2.png)

When the program comes back from executing the function `func`, it comes back at the address `0x0804920f` and executes the following code: 

```assembly
 0x0804920f <+52>:    add    $0x4,%esp
 0x08049212 <+55>:    mov    %eax,-0x4(%ebp)
 0x08049215 <+58>:    cmpl   $0x0,-0x4(%ebp)
 0x08049219 <+62>:    jne    0x804922f <main+84>
```

This roughly corresponds to the part of the code storing the result of `func` into `res`, and doing the test `if (! res)`. The way the C compiler works is that if the test is true (i.e., the string entered is different from "secret"), then the program just goes to the next line and executes the code corresponding to printing "you are denied"; if the test is not true (i.e., the string entered is "secret"), the program jumps to the address  `0x804922f` and executes corresponding to printing "you are allowed". 

In other words, if, when coming back from `func`, we could go to the address `0x804922f` instead of `0x0804920f`, we would get "you are allowed", even if the input string is different from "secret". 

To do so, our goal is to modify the return address value to `0x804922f` using the Buffer Overflow. First, we set up the breakpoint at the end of `func` and inspect the stack around `$ebp`: 

![Demo step2 - 2](Demo step2 - 2.png)

Without any buffer-overflow, we can see that the return address in the stack is indeed `0x0804920f` (remember the first value is the previous frame pointer). If we create a buffer overflow, the return address is erased, as it was for `step1` above: 

![Demo step2 - 3](Demo step2 - 3.png)

How can change the return value to the desired address, rather than `0x41414141`? First, we need to find the correct length of the buffer. If you are an expert in virtual memory, you might be able to compute it directly. Otherwise, you can just try a few values (we at least know it must be more than 32, since that is the size of `buf`). If we try with 40: 

![Demo step2 - 4](Demo step2 - 4.png)

We see that we've erased everything up to and including the return address. To check this, we can try a different ending of the input string, using the construct ``r `perl -e 'print "A" x 36 . "BBBB"'` ``, which outputs 36 "A" followed by 4 "B": 

![Demo step2 - 5](Demo step2 - 5.png)

Now, our return address is `0x42424242` (42 is the ASCII code for "B"). We're getting close, but what we really want is the address `0x804922f` instead. Unfortunately, we can't just write ``r `perl -e 'print "A" x 36 . "0x804922f"'` `` .  Hexadecimal values need to be input slightly differently. In particular, we need to start with the values at the end of the word: ``r `perl -e 'print "A" x 36 . "\x2f\x92\x04\x08"'` ``. You might want to read about big-endian/little-endian if you're interested, but this is not particularly important here! 

![Demo step2 - 6](Demo step2 - 6.png)

Success, we've managed to get the program to print "you are allowed", even though we didn't input the string "secret"! It also works directly from the command-line (no need to use `gdb`), have a go at it!

## Branching Functions

In the attack against `step2`, we just jumped a few memory addresses in order to bypass the check. We can do much more than that, and in particular, we can reroute the program execution to any function available in the code. For instance, inspect the code for `step3`. I would suggest you start directly from the binary using the command `objdump -d`, which will disassemble the code for you. If you are not really sure, you can also have a look at the source code. Can you get the program to execute the secret code? 

I would encourage to look for the solution first. If you can't get it to work, the solution is in the comment of this post. 

<!-- The answer is ./step3 `perl -e 'print "A" x 36 . "\xf4\x84\x04\x08"'` -->

The last piece of code for branching functions is `step4`. Can you find out how to exploit it? `step4` can be particularly dangerous if it is setup with SETUID (see below for more details on this). 


## Shell Injection 

Up until now, we have always redirected the control flow to code already existing. In practice, it's unlikely a good programmer is going to leave some critical dead code or a way to input some arbitrary commands. The final step we consider in this tutorial is to directly inject code in the stack and to redirect the control flow to this code. 

The basic idea is summarised in the picture below. Instead of filling the buffer with "A", we insert assembly instructions which correspond to the command "/bin/sh". We then need to modify the return address to point to the buffer. To realise this attack, this means we need to know the address of buffer. 

![Demo - Shell Injection](Demo - Shell Injection.png)



This part of the attack is a bit more technical. The file `src/exploit.c` contains the code allowing to generate the specific input we need to realise this attack. We won't go into the details here, but please have a look if you are interested! 

To do a demonstration of the attack, you first need to run as root the script `setup.sh`. This script: 

- Installs the shell `zsh`, which is less secure than `sh` against privilege-escalation
- Replaces `/bin/sh` by `/bin/zsh`
- Disables [address space layout randomization (ASLR)](https://linux-audit.com/linux-aslr-and-kernelrandomize_va_space-setting/), which makes it harder for attacker to guess where information is stored in memory
- Gives the ownership of the binary `step5` to the root user, with [SETUID](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/setuid.htm) set, meaning that whoever runs `step5` will run this program as root. 

All these steps are essential to be able to realise the shell execution attack. It is important to realise that those steps are effectively lowering the security of your system, so you should only do this on a machine you control and that has no critical data (e.g., a VM specifically designed for security testing).

It is also worth mentioning that `step5` has been compiled with some security features removed, in particular there are no [stack protector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow#Stack_canaries) and the stack is made executable (by default it is not). The required options are available in the script `src/compile.sh`. 

So if you run things in order, you should see (the output might be slightly different if zsh is not already installed): 

```bash
~bof$ sudo sh setup.sh
[sudo] password for kali: 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
zsh is already the newest version (5.8-5).

~/bof$ ./exploit 128 100

# whoami                                                                                       
root
#
```



Note the argument for the `exploit` script. They should work on your machine, I invite you to have a look at `src/exploit.c` to understand why we need those. After executing the last command, we get a shell with root privileges. Congratulations, you've conducted a privilege escalation using a buffer overflow! 

# To explore further

The binary in this repository are for a 32 bits architecture. The problem is slightly different in a 64 bits architecture, although the overall principle remains the same. There is a very nice blog post from Jon Gjengset on ["Smashing the Stack in the 21st Century"](https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/smashing-the-stack-21st-century/) (see the Credits for the reference in the title). The security research *null byte* also published a nice tutorial about a [Basic Buffer Overflow on 64-bit Architecture](https://medium.com/@buff3r/basic-buffer-overflow-on-64-bit-architecture-3fb74bab3558). 

Another interesting aspect is [Return-Oriented Programming](https://codearcana.com/posts/2013/05/28/introduction-to-return-oriented-programming-rop.html). Intuitively, the idea is to consider what we have done for `step3`, but using tiny pieces of the huge amount of libraries existing in the system, and chaining them together to obtain the desired execution. This is quite advanced, but can be very powerful! 



# Credits

The reference work is the article ["Smashing The Stack For Fun and Profit"](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa08/papers/stack_smashing.pdf), published in 1996 by Aleph One (a.k.a. [Elias Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Levy)). Buffer overflow attacks were known before, but this was the first clear tutorial. In Newcastle University, Francisco Rocha (then a PhD student in computer security at Newcastle University, currently Security Engineer at Moteefe) did a tremendous job of adapting this tutorial for our students in the MSc in Computer Security and Resilience. Charles Morisset has refined the examples and code over the years, and wrote this repository and tutorial, which can be freely copied and used. Merge requests for improvement and corrections are welcome!
